The result should be better studies that respond clearly to precisely formulated questions.\n",

    "* **A decline in false-positive publications.** If publication decisions are based on outcome-neutral criteria — which are largely addressed before conducting the study — then researchers will not be motivated to engage in practices that increase the likelihood of making a type I error. Results from studies that utilize such practices, separate from a pre-registered analytic plan, would be publishable strictly as exploratory research.\n",

This could lead to a decline in funding for such projects, and the discoveries that such research can yield.\n",
