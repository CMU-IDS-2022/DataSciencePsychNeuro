    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Figures can convey what words cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key to using good visualizations is to reduce the complexity of written prose when a visual image will get across the same information more intuitively. This is often helpful when describing your methods. Consider this figure of a behavioral task.\n",

Participants get points for being as close to the target line as possible. On some trials the bar stops and turns red (a stop signal), indicating that participants shouldn't press a button to stop the bar anymore. The bottom panel (B) shows the different groups, where the stop signal is sampled from one of 3 probability distributions (Uniform, Early, & Late). Probe stop signals are also included for all subjects at 200, 250, 300, 350, and 400ms. \n",

    "\n",
    "## 2. Cluttered figures discourage the reader from trying to understand your argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "While a good figure can make your story easier to tell, a bad figure can completely ruin your narrative. If you put too much in your figure (e.g., too many panels, high density of visual information per figure, too much text), then your reader spends more time examining the figure than they are reading the text. Remember _graphics are supposed to make the reader's job easier, not harder_.\n",

    "The left panel shows your standard bar plot of the means with standard error acorss conditions. But standard error (along with standard deviation and variance) _assume_ that you have symmetrical distributions around the mean. This is almost always not correct. You can see this in the middle panel, which shows the mean and standard error as black dots and error bars respectively, but this figure also plots each individual data point in each group. So you can see the spread of the data and clearly see the whole variability in each group. Another way to show this (if you have a lot of data and showing individual data points is tricky, is to use violin plots (right panel) that show the estimated kernel desnity of the distribution of the data instead. \n",
